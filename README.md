Object Tracing with UAV in AirSim Environment
=====
### This is the repository for COMP90055 computing project in University of Melbourne. 
Our project focus on designing algorithms for detecting certain objects and applying reinforcement algorithms to do motion control to locate these objects.  The environment we use is [AirSim](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim) by Microsoft.
