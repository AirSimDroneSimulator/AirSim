===============

Title
-------

The effect of deep reinforcement learning algorithms on the performance of object detection.

HYPOTHESIS
--------- 

YOLO Real-Time Object Detection method can performance better than naive image classification in terms of locating an specific object in 3D environment while flying.

Independent Variables
-----------

YOLO Real-Time Object Detection method and naive image classification

Levels of Indenpent variable and numbers of repeated trails
---------

Level 1: Using classified images set from internet with different kinds of object as inputs.

Level 2: Using an image captured by drone’s camera as inputs to find object that we set in the environment before.

Level 3: Using classification or detection results of several continuous frames to increase the rate of drone finding object successfully.

Dependent variable and how measure
--------

Measurement:

Calculate the accuracy of different methods (if the image includes the object we set) and compare success rate of finding object we set successfully.

Constants
-----------

1. Using Neighborhood Airsim drone Environment.

2. Images from drone's camera.
